## 📑 Introduction to SWE-Pruner

<p align="center"><img src="./images/overview.jpg" style="width: 85%; height: auto;" alt="Tokens Cost Reduction"></p>

Are you struggling with **excessive token costs** and latency when using LLM agents for software development? Traditional context compression often relies on fixed metrics like perplexity (PPL) and ignores task-specific code understanding. But **generic compression ≠ relevant preservation** — we need **task-aware context pruning** that retains critical implementation details.

Inspired by how human programmers "selectively skim" source code, **SWE-Pruner** enables agents to formulate explicit goals and uses a lightweight neural skimmer to **dynamically select relevant code lines**. It operates in two key steps:
- Formulate task-specific goals to guide the pruning process
- Dynamically select relevant code lines using a lightweight neural skimmer

## 🎯 Core Features

**🧠 Task-Aware Pruning**
  Understands the *intent* (e.g., "focus on error handling") and uses it to guide context pruning process, beyond generic metrics.

**🤖 Coding Agent Native**
  Built for multi-turn workflows and integrates seamlessly into agent decision loops, providing just-in-time context for complex software engineering tasks.

**🎨 Semantic Highlight**
  A lightweight [0.6B model](https://huggingface.co/ayanami-kitasan/code-pruner) identifies and preserves semantically critical lines of code, keeping logical structures intact.

**⚡ Extreme Compression**
  Delivers significant token savings without sacrificing performance: **23-54%** token reduction on [SWE-Bench Verified](https://openai.com/index/introducing-swe-bench-verified/) and up to **14.84x** compression on [LongCodeQA](https://github.com/Zteefano/long-code-bench), cutting API costs and latency.

**🔧 Flexibly Use**
  Adaptable framework for various LLMs and scenarios, from debugging to feature development.

## 🧰 Prerequisites

This project uses `uv` for fast and efficient dependency management.

## 🎮 Quick Start

Go to [Inference Tutorial](./swe-pruner/README.md) and have a try!

> Tips: For easier serving and reproducing, we upload our models in `./swe-pruner/model` directory(tracked by git lfs). It make the serving more simple but greatly increase the repo size if you use `git clone` directly (and might failed to download model for traffic limit of github lfs service). However, you can use the methods in the tutorial to download it from HuggingFace.


## ⚙️ Installation

Since different modules have different dependencies, please refer to the specific `README` file inside each subfolder for detailed installation instructions.

## 📖 User Guides

- For Users, look [Inference Tutorial](./swe-pruner/README.md) to start a swe-pruner locally and then reading [real world examples](examples/README.md) for agents integration.
  - We now support [OpenHands](https://github.com/OpenHands/OpenHands) and [Claude Agent SDK](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-agent-sdk-python)!

- For Developers, look `./train`(coming soon) for training a pruner by yourself!

- For Researchers, `./downstream_eval` has some scripts for reproducing our results. We recommend to use [slurm](https://github.com/SchedMD/slurm) with at least 4 GPU to reuse our scripts.


## 🔮 Coming Soon
- [ ] 💻 Update Training Code
- [ ] 📁 Upload full parameters and trajectory files & logs
- [x] 🤗 Update HuggingFace model card
- [x] 🤗 Update HuggingFace blog to introducing our  technical approach in detail.
- [x] 🎮 Update agents integrate demo
